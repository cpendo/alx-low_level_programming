### OVERVIEW

The 0x03-debugging directory contains solutions to the alx project tasks aimed at testing my knowledge of debugging
using the C language.

## Task 0. Multiple mains
 
Copy the `main.h` and `the 0-main.c` provided and edit the files to test a case where 0 is the the input for a function `positive_or_negative()`.

The correct output after testing is:

```
0 is negative
```

## Task 1. Like, comment, subscribe
Copy the given main file into file `1-main.c`. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

The correct output after testing is:

```
Infinite loop incoming :(
Infinite loop avoided! \o/
```

## Task 2. 0 > 972?
Fix the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

The correct output after testing is:

```
972 is the largest number
```
